## 🔍 Analysis

### 1. **Suspicious Sender**
- The domain `@netflix-bill.com` is not associated with the legitimate Netflix domain (`@netflix.com`).
- Attackers often register lookalike domains to trick users.

### 2. **Urgency Tactic**
- “Your account will be suspended in 24 hours” is meant to pressure the recipient into acting without thinking.
- This is a classic **social engineering** technique.

### 3. **Phishing Link**
- The link leads to a fake login page designed to steal credentials.
- The domain `netflix-update-payment.com` is not a known Netflix property.

### 4. **Generic Greeting**
- Legitimate services usually address customers by name.
- “Dear Customer” is a red flag.

## Prevention Tips

- **Verify the sender’s domain** before clicking links.
- **Do not click** suspicious links — hover to preview the URL first.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication** (MFA) to protect accounts even if credentials are stolen.
- Report phishing emails to your security team or service provider.
